# HTML CSS JS Starter Repo

A starter repo for HTML CSS and Javascript projects.

## HTML File

We first start by creating an index.html file at the root of the repo. This will be the main website page.

## CSS Folder/Files

Next we create a folder to hold our css files. You can also place a styles.css file directly at the root of the repo if you know for sure that's all you need. But for organization purposes and in case there will be more than one css file, I like to create folder to hold css files.

## JS Folder/Files

Next we create a folder to hold our Javascript files. You can also place an index.js file directly at the root of the repo if you know for sure that's all you need. But for organization purposes and in case there will be more than one js file, I like to create folder to hold js files.

## Assets

Next we create a folder to holde assets such as images, fonts, videos, etc. Feel free to delete any that you don't need for you project.
